# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2023-04-20

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

Once upon a time, in the land of South Africa, there was a Portuguese colonialist named Wilhelm Ferreira. Now, Wilhelm was a character to say the least. He was known throughout the land for his eccentric personality and his outlandish sense of humor.

One day, Wilhelm was walking through the streets of Cape Town when he came across a group of local children playing soccer. Being the playful and mischievous man that he was, Wilhelm decided to join in on the fun. He took the ball and began to show off his skills, juggling the ball with his feet and doing fancy tricks.

The children were amazed and delighted by Wilhelm's display of talent, but Wilhelm had a trick up his sleeve. He suddenly kicked the ball as hard as he could and it went flying into a nearby tree. The children gasped in surprise and disappointment, but Wilhelm just laughed and said, "Don't worry, kids. I'll get it down for you."

With that, Wilhelm climbed up the tree, but he soon found that the ball was stuck in a very precarious position. He couldn't reach it with his hands, so he decided to use his head. He leaned forward and tried to headbutt the ball, but instead, he headbutted the branch and fell to the ground with a loud thud.

The children rushed over to him, concerned for his well-being, but Wilhelm just laughed it off and said, "Don't worry, kids. I'm made of tough stuff."

And indeed he was. Wilhelm picked himself up and brushed himself off, but he soon realized that something was amiss. He had lost his favorite hat in the fall.

Now, Wilhelm's hat was a very special hat. It had been passed down to him by his grandfather, who had been a famous explorer in Portugal. Wilhelm cherished the hat and was devastated to have lost it.

He searched high and low for his hat, but it was nowhere to be found. He even put up flyers around town, offering a reward for its safe return. But no one came forward.

Wilhelm was heartbroken, but he refused to give up. He spent all his time searching for the hat, even going so far as to sneak into the homes of suspected hat thieves.

But his search was in vain. The hat was gone forever.

One day, Wilhelm was sitting in a caf√©, nursing a cup of coffee and feeling sorry for himself, when he overheard a group of men talking about a Portuguese explorer who had come to South Africa many years ago. They were discussing the explorer's many adventures and the treasures he had brought back with him.

Wilhelm's interest was piqued, and he listened intently to their conversation. One of the men mentioned that the explorer had left behind a treasure map, which was said to lead to a great fortune.

Wilhelm knew he had to have that map. He begged and pleaded with the men to tell him more, but they refused to divulge any further information.

Determined to get his hands on the map, Wilhelm came up with a plan. He decided to disguise himself as a member of the local tribe and infiltrate their community. He learned their language and their customs and soon became one of them.

It wasn't long before he gained their trust and was accepted into their inner circle. He waited patiently for the opportunity to present itself, and when it finally did, he seized it with both hands.

One night, while the tribe was asleep, Wilhelm snuck into the chief's hut and rummaged through his belongings. He found the treasure map, which was hidden in a secret compartment in the chief's chest.

Wilhelm was overjoyed. He had finally found what he had been searching for all these years. He quickly made his escape and returned
